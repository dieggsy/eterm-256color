This package uses [[https://github.com/atomontage/xterm-color][xterm-color]] to add customizable 256 color support to ~term~
and ~ansi-term~.

** Usage
Add ~eterm-256color-mode~ to ~term-mode-hook~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'term-mode-hook #'eterm-256color-mode)
#+end_src
Enjoy more colors.

*** Notes
- This package requires ~eterm-color~. If it doesn't exist on your system, you
  will be offered the option of fetching and compiling it from [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs][emacs-mirror]].
  If instead you want to install manually, you can try:
  * linux
    #+begin_src sh
    tic $(find /usr/share/emacs -name 'eterm-color.ti')
    # or
    mkdir -p ~/.terminfo/e/
    cp $(find /usr/share/emacs -name 'eterm-color') ~/.terminfo/e/
    #+end_src
  * macOS
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     tic $(find $(brew --prefix emacs)/ -name 'eterm-color.ti')
     # or
     tic ~/.terminfo $(find $(brew --prefix emacs-plus)/ -name 'eterm-color.ti')
     # or
     tic ~/.terminfo /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/etc/e/eterm-color.ti
     #+END_SRC
- You may have to restart ansi-term the very first time you start it after
  installing this package and adding the hook above - it should "just work" any
  time after that.
- Make sure ~TERM~ really gets set to ~eterm-256color~. It may be
  overridden if you export ~TERM~ in any of your shell init files.

** Installation
This package is on melpa. If you have melpa in your package repositiories, you
can use ~M-x RET package-install RET eterm-256color~ or install with
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package eterm-256color
  :ensure t)
#+end_src

Alternatively, consider installing with [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] or
[[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]].

Otherwise, download the files to somewhere in your load path, and require
eterm-256color:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'eterm-256color)
#+end_src

If installing manually, make sure the file ~eterm-256color.ti~ is in the same
place as ~eterm-256color.el~.

** Customization
*** Bold
You can use the variable ~eterm-256color-disable-bold~ disable bold colors.
When specified as bold, colors 0 - 7 will be rendered with their "bright"
counterpart instead.
*** Faces
Each of the 256 faces is customizable:
| Face                                       | Alias               | Note                                      |

Note that to customize the first 16 colors you can either customize the
variables ~xterm-color-names~ and ~xterm-color-names-bright~ or customize the
faces directly.
